    Homeshick has been installed, personal dotfiles repos cloned, and linked.
    If any of the dotfiles already existed, the ones in this repo will not be
    linked. Now is the time to check that out, remove files as need and run the
    homeshick -s link command again.

    Finally, clone any local castle (for .bashrc.local, etc.) and link again.
